Informational Message: The current Metropolis proposal is about to be rejected because of the following issue:
Exception: Exception: Exception: Exception: integrate_ode_rk45: initial state[1] is inf, but must be finite! (in 'Treg_dynamics/stan_models/MAP_Incumbent_simple.stan', line 94, column 6 to column 123) (in 'Treg_dynamics/stan_models/MAP_Incumbent_simple.stan', line 107, column 4 to column 48) (in 'Treg_dynamics/stan_models/MAP_Incumbent_simple.stan', line 129, column 6 to column 75) (in 'Treg_dynamics/stan_models/MAP_Incumbent_simple.stan', line 321, column 4 to column 89)
If this warning occurs sporadically, such as for highly constrained variable types like covariance matrices, then the sampler is fine,
but if this warning occurs often then your model may be either severely ill-conditioned or misspecified.
